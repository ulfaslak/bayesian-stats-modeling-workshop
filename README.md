# Hands-On Bayesian Modeling:

## Building and Fitting Predictive Models with PyMC

This workshop introduces you to the very basics of PyMC and Bayesian modeling, and shows how to build and fit simple models to data. I have designed it so you can read through it and understand, but during the workshop I will guide you as well.

After having completed this workshop, you should be able to define and fit smaller models in PyMC and hopefully have a sense of what problems you can tackle with PyMC in your own work.
